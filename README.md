# doom-emacs-configuration
Custom configuration for Doom Emacs

*The sane layout for insane world. Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ is being attacked and destroyed by terrorist state of russia. Help ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦UkraineðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦! Defend the World from russian fascism!*

## Installation

(Given you have Doom Emacs installed as described here https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs#install)

```sh
mv ~/.doom.d ~./.doom.d.backup # backup if needed
git clone https://github.com/vlnn/doom-emacs-configuration/ ~/.doom.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync
```

## What's inside

This is primitive but not-so-clean configuration of doom-emacs. Of course you should grow your own. No problem, just steal interesting stuff from here as I did before.

Some features you may expect to be working:

1. Commented `config.el` where every implemented idea has at least one comment.
1. Use blasphemous `jkl;` instead everyone's loved `hjkl` in evil-mode. There is a good reason for that, and you should buy one for yourself -- it's called Kinesis Advantage. See https://github.com/vlnn/kinesis-advantage-2 for more.

## If something doesn't work

Please open an issue (preferably followed by PR). I'll investigate and at least communicate my thoughts back to you (or even implement something useful!)
